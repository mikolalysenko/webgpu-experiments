# Project log

## 01-15-2023

* Working through documentation on WebGPU API.  Built another trivial demo with a rotating icosahedron to test my knowledge of uniforms and indexed rendering.
* Added a demo with point sprites to try emulating WebGL-style `GL_POINTS`.  Unfortunately the performance seems really bad, but maybe I am doing something wrong. Will ask around for advice.

## 01-14-2023

* Set up repository and build scripts.  Got a triangle rendering based on https://austin-eng.com/webgpu-samples/samples/helloTriangle.
